#Odin Project project: Landing page

In this folder are contained the files for the project "Recipes" that has to be done at the end of The Odin Project section about CSS and Fleabox.
In this project I will create an entire web page based on a given design, using skills and knownledge about color, class, CSS and HTML intercomunication and FLeabox usage.
